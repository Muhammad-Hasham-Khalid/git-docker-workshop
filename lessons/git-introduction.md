Let's see the how the git website defines git, it's pretty straight forward and self explanatory:

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

But, wait a minute, what is a **VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM** ???

## VCS (Version Control System)

Let's see how microsoft's website explains what a version control system is:

> Version control systems are software that help track changes make in code over time.

But why do I need a version control system???

## Need of VCS

Without version control, developers are tempted to keep multiple copies of code on their computer. This is dangerous because it's easy to change or delete a file in the wrong copy of code, potentially losing work. Version control systems solve this problem by managing all versions of the code, but presenting the team with a single version at a time.
